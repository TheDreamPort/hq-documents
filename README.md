# hq-documents
this repository holds fake 'sensitive' documents that have been created for DreamPort events. These documents are used to populate file shares and endpoints user directories with semi-realistic files that can be used to track audit events, network events etc. There are two basic goals for this project:

1. Create steady stream of files that look like normal business documents
1. Create scripts (e.g. Python) that will create new official looking documents

The best way to think of this repo is a slight customization of the many Microsoft Office template documents thate are available across PowerPoint, Excel and Word. We strive to provide realism for any project or experiment we undertake and these resources are meant to demonstrate this goal.

The following top-level directories are found in this repository:
* files   - holds the actual files that have been created. These are organized by the type of office environment we are trying to emulate.
* scripts - holds scripts that have been created to produce new documents.
* templates - partial documents used to in conjunction with scripts to produce new files
