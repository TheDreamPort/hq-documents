# hq-documents
this repository holds fake 'sensitive' documents that have been created for DreamPort events. These documents are used to populate file shares and endpoints with semi-realistic files that can be used to track audit events, network events etc. There are two basic goals for this project:

1. Create steady stream of files that look like normal business documents
1. Create scripts (e.g. Python) that will create new official looking documents

The best way to think of this repo is a slight customization of the many Microsoft Office template documents thate are available across PowerPoint, Excel and Word.

There are two top-level directories in this repository:
* Files   - holds the actual files that have been created
* Scripts - holds scripts that have been created to produce new documents.
