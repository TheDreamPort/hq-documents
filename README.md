# hq-documents
this repository holds fake 'sensitive' documents that have been created for DreamPort events. These documents are used to populate file shares and endpoints with semi-realistic files that can be used to track audit events, network events etc. There are two basic goals for this project:

1. Create steady stream of files that look like normal business documents
1. Create scripts (e.g. Python) that will create new official looking documents
